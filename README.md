Binary Ninja Inspectors
--

This is a big collection of inspectors and sidebars for Binary Ninja that I have made and regularly use.
They are not really polished or guaranteed to work for people other than myself, but you may get good use out of them.
Note that many of them (looking at you, Linear Inspector) have abyssmal performance and turn your sidebar game into a bit of a minefield ;)

## Analysis Progress
See where your analysis is running (or stalled, as often seems to be the use case)
